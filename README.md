# Dog Party Project
This site is my first crack at creating and replicating a web page using HTML and CSS. This page was replicated from a screen shot that was provided from instructors at Turing School of Design. 

## Motivation
This site was built without Flexbox or CSS Grids, so its intetion was to familiarize me with the use of floats and formating a site without using those tools.
